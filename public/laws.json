redacted, provided the encryption key was not also accessed or acquired.\n\n### Regulatory Exemptions\n- An Entity is exempt if it is subject to or regulated by (a) federal laws, rules, regulations, procedures, or guidance or (b) state laws, rules, regulations, procedures, or guidance that are at least as thorough as the notice requirements in this law; maintains procedures pursuant to those requirements; provides notice to consumers pursuant to those requirements; and timely provides notice to the Attorney General when the number of affected individuals exceeds 1,000\n- Entities subject

Third-party service providers must cooperate with data owners, including sharing information relevant to the breach (but not requiring disclosure of confidential business information or trade secrets).\n\n## Exemptions, Penalties, and Other Provisions\n\n### Encryption Safe Harbor\nThe law provides a safe harbor for encrypted data.\n\n### Regulatory Exemptions\nEntities regulated by state or federal law (including GLBA and HIPAA) that maintain procedures pursuant to those laws are deemed compliant with the statute, provided that notice to the Attorney General is still required if the **500**-resident threshold is met.\n\n**Important:** Where timing conflicts exist, the law or regulation with the shortest notice timeframe controls.\n\n### Penalties\nThe Attorney General may bring an action to address violations and recover direct economic damages.\n\n### Private Right of Action\nThe statute does not provide for a private right of action.\n\n## Key Provisions\n\n### Delay for Law Enforcement\nNotification may be delayed if a law enforcement agency determines that notification will impede a criminal investigation. Notification shall be made after the law enforcement agency determines that notification will no longer impede the investigation.\n\n### Timing Conflicts\nIf there is a conflict between the 30-day deadline and an applicable state or federal law, the law or regulation with the shortest timeframe for notice to the individual controls. This rule also applies to Attorney General notification timing.\n"

A third-party agent must provide the entity with all information that the entity needs to comply with notice requirements.\n\n**Important:** A third-party agent may provide notice to the Department or affected individuals on behalf of the entity; however, a third-party agent's failure to provide proper notice shall be deemed a violation against the entity.\n\n## Exemptions, Penalties, and Other Provisions\n\n### Encryption Safe Harbor\nThe law provides a safe harbor for encrypted data or data modified to remove identifying elements.\n\n### Primary Regulator Exemption\nNotification pursuant to laws, rules, regulations, guidance, or guidelines established by an entity's primary or functional state regulator is sufficient for compliance.\n\n### Credit Monitoring Services\nIf the breach involves Social Security numbers, the entity must offer complimentary credit monitoring services to affected individuals.

The civil penalties apply per breach, not per individual affected by the breach.\n\n### Private Right of Action\nThere is no private cause of action.\n\n## Key Provisions\n\n### Delay for Law Enforcement\nNotice to individuals may be delayed for a specified period that the law enforcement agency determines is reasonably necessary in a written request if a law enforcement agency determines that the notice will impede a criminal investigation. A law enforcement agency may, by a subsequent written request, revoke such delay as of a specified date or extend the period specified in the original request made to a specified date if further delay is necessary.\n\n### Public Records Exemption\nAll information received by the Department pursuant to the notification requirements or pursuant to a law enforcement or Department investigation is confidential and exempt from the Public Records requirement under the State Constitution and statutes.\n\n### Attorney General Enforcement\nThe Attorney General may bring an action to address violations of this statute.\n"

The notice shall be provided without unreasonable delay after the law enforcement agency communicates to the entity its determination that notice will no longer impede the investigation or jeopardize national security.\n\n### Government Agency Reporting\nA government agency shall submit a written report to the legislature within **20 days** after discovery of a security breach at the government agency that details:\n- Information relating to the nature of the breach\n- The number of individuals affected by the breach\n- A copy of the notice of security breach that was issued\n- The number of individuals to whom the notice was sent\n- Whether the notice was delayed due to law enforcement considerations\n- Any procedures that have been implemented to prevent the breach from reoccurring\n\n### Waiver Not Permitted\nEntities cannot waive compliance with this statute.\n\n### Private Right of Action\nHawaii is one of the few states that explicitly grants a private right of action, allowing injured parties to bring actions to recover actual damages.\n"

Laws § 445.63, 72 et seq.`)/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Act-452-of-2004)\n- **Statute Title:** [Michigan Data Security Breach Notification Act](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(coogkoj4auhryicmiduwiqyr))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Act-452-of-2004)\n- **Jurisdiction Type:** U.S. State\n- **Legislative History:**\n  - **Original Legislation:** S.B. 309 (signed December 30, 2006, Public Act 566, effective July 2, 2007)\n  - **Major Amendments:**\n    - S.B. 223 (signed December 21, 2010, effective April 1, 2011)\n    - H.B. 6406 (signed December 28, 2018, effective January 20, 2020)\n  - **Last Verified:** September 2025\n\n## Application & Covered Entities\nAny individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, association, or other legal entity, or any department, board, commission, office, agency, authority, or other unit of state government of Michigan that owns or licenses data including personal information of a Michigan resident.\n\n## Key Definitions\n\n### Personal Information\nThe first name or first initial and last name linked to one or more of the following data elements of a resident of Michigan:\n- Social Security number\n- Driver's license number or state personal identification card number\n- Demand deposit or other financial account number, or credit card or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to any of the resident's financial accounts\n\n### Breach of Security\nThe unauthorized access and acquisition of data that compromises the security or confidentiality of personal information maintained by an Entity as part of a database of personal information regarding multiple individuals.\n\n### Good-Faith Exception\nA good-faith but unauthorized acquisition of personal information by an employee or other individual, where the access was related to the activities of the Entity, is not a breach of security unless the personal information is misused or disclosed to an unauthorized person. In making this determination, an Entity shall act with the care an ordinarily prudent Entity in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances.\n\n## Notification Requirements & Triggers\n\n### Notification Obligation\nAn Entity that owns or licenses data including Michigan residents shall provide notice of the breach to each resident of Michigan if (i) the resident's unencrypted and unredacted personal information was accessed and acquired by an unauthorized person or (ii) the resident's personal information was accessed and acquired in encrypted form by a person with unauthorized access to the encryption key.\n\n**Exception:** Notification is not required if the Entity determines that the security breach has not or is not likely to cause substantial loss or injury to, or result in identity theft with respect to, one or more residents of Michigan. This section does not apply to the access or acquisition by a person or agency of federal, state, or local government records or documents lawfully made available to the general public.\n\n### Timing of Notification\nThe notification shall be given without unreasonable delay following discovery of the breach, consistent with measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach of the security of a system or restore the integrity of the system.\n\n### Notification Methods\nNotice may be provided by one of the following methods:\n- Written notice sent to the recipient at the recipient's postal address in the records of the Entity\n- Telephonic notice given by an individual who represents the Entity if (i) the notice is not given in whole or in part by use of a recorded message, (ii) the recipient has expressly consented to receive notice by telephone, or if the recipient has not expressly consented to receive notice by telephone, the Entity also provides notice pursuant to the above methods if the notice by telephone does not result in a live conversation between the individual representing the Entity and the recipient within 3 business days after the initial attempt to provide telephonic notice\n- Written notice sent electronically to the recipient if (i) the recipient has expressly consented to receive electronic notice, (ii) the Entity has an existing business relationship with the recipient that includes periodic email communications and based on those communications the Entity reasonably believes that it has the recipient's current email address, or (iii) the Entity conducts its business primarily through Internet account transactions or on the Internet\n\n### Content of Notice to Individuals\nA notice under the statute shall:\n- Be written in a clear and conspicuous manner, and shall clearly communicate the content required\n- Describe the security breach in general terms\n- Describe the type of personal information that is the subject of the unauthorized access or use\n- If applicable, generally describe what the agency or person providing the notice has done to protect data from further security breaches\n- Include a telephone number where a notice recipient may obtain assistance or additional information\n- Remind notice recipients of the need to remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft\n\n### Consumer Reporting Agency Notification\nIf an Entity notifies **1,000** or more Michigan residents, the Entity shall, after notifying those residents, notify each nationwide consumer reporting agency without unreasonable delay of the number and timing of notices that the person or agency provided to residents of the state. This subsection does not apply if the person or agency is subject to Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\n\n### Substitute Notice Available\nIf the Entity demonstrates that:\n- The cost of providing notice would exceed **$250,000**, OR\n- The Entity has to provide notice to more than **500,000** residents of Michigan, OR\n- The Entity does not have sufficient contact information\n\nSubstitute notice shall consist of all of the following:\n- Email notice, if the Entity has email addresses for any of the residents of Michigan who are entitled to receive notice\n- Conspicuous posting on the Entity's website, if the Entity maintains one\n- Notification to major statewide media, which notice shall include a telephone number or website address that a person may use to obtain additional assistance and information\n\n### Public Utility Notice\nA public utility that sends monthly billing or account statements to its customers may provide notice of a security breach to its customers as provided under the statute or by providing all of the following:\n- As applicable, email notice in accordance with the statute\n- Notice to the media reasonably calculated to inform the utility's customers of the breach\n- Conspicuous posting of notice of the security breach on the website of the utility\n- Written notice sent in conjunction with the billing or account statement sent to the customer at his or her postal address in the utility's records\n\n### Third-Party Data Notification\nAn Entity that maintains a database that includes data that the Entity does not own or license that discovers a breach of the security of the database shall provide notice to the owner or licensor of the information of the security breach, unless the Entity determines that the security breach has not or is not likely to cause substantial loss or injury to, or result in identity theft with respect to one or more residents of Michigan.\n\n## Exemptions, Penalties, and Other Provisions\n\n### Encryption Safe Harbor\nThe law provides a safe harbor for encrypted data.\n\n### Federal Interagency Guidance\nA financial institution that is subject to and in compliance with the Federal Interagency Guidance Response Programs for Unauthorized Access to Consumer Information and Customer Notice, issued on March 7, 2005, by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, and any revisions, additions, or substitutions relating to said interagency guidance, shall be deemed to be in compliance.\n\n### HIPAA-Covered Entities\nA provider of health care, health care service plan, health insurer, or a covered entity governed by the medical privacy and security rules issued by the federal Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) shall be deemed in compliance with this chapter.\n\n### Insurers\nEntities subject to, or regulated under Michigan's insurance code are exempt from the state's data breach notification statute and instead will be governed by H.B. 6491/Public Act 690 of 2018, which goes into effect January 20, 2021.\n\n### Penalties\n**Criminal Penalties:** Provides for criminal penalties for notice of a security breach that has not occurred, where such notice is given with the intent to defraud. The offense is a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 30 days or a fine of not more than **$250** per violation (or both). The penalty is the same for second and third violations, except that the fine increases to **$500** per violation and **$750** per violation, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, Entities who distribute an advertisement or make any other solicitation that misrepresents to the recipient that a security breach has occurred that may affect the recipient are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than **$1,000** per violation (or both). The penalty is the same for second and third violations, except that the fine increases to **$2,000** per violation and **$3,000** per violation, respectively.\n\n**Civil Penalties:** Entities who fail to provide notice may be ordered to pay a civil fine of not more than **$250** for each failure to provide notice, capped at **$750,000** per security breach. These penalties do not affect the availability of civil remedies under state or federal law.\n\n### Private Right of Action\nThe statute does not include a private right of action but notes that other legal remedies are not eliminated.\n\n## Key Provisions\n\n### Delay for Law Enforcement\nNotice may be delayed if a law enforcement agency determines that the notice will impede a criminal investigation or jeopardize homeland or national security. Notification shall be given as soon as reasonably practicable after the law enforcement agency determines that it will not impede a criminal investigation and will not jeopardize homeland or national security.\n\n### Attorney General Enforcement\nThe Attorney General has authority to enforce this statute.\n\n### Third-Party Delivery\nEntities may deliver notice pursuant to an agreement with another Entity, if the agreement does not conflict with Michigan law.\n"

a breach of security.\n\n### Compliance with Federal Regulations\nAny person that maintains a security breach procedure pursuant to the rules, regulations, or guidelines established by the primary

This includes:\n- Electronic access to the database system, OR\n- Physical access to the database system, OR\n- Physical access to recording media containing the information\n\n### Notification Trigger - Critical Distinction\n**Notification is required only if:** The breached database contains, in whole or in part, personal information files **not protected by encrypted code but only by a password**.\n\nThis means password-only protection does **not** provide a safe harbor; encrypted code is specifically required.\n\n## Notification Requirements & Triggers\n\n### Notification Obligation\nAny entity must notify citizens of any breach of the security system when the breached database contains personal information files not protected by encrypted code but only by a password.\n\n### Timing of Notification\n**To Affected Individuals:** As expeditiously as possible, taking into consideration:\n- The need of law enforcement agencies to secure possible crime scenes and evidence\n- The application of measures needed to restore the system's security\n\n### Notification Methods\nNotice may be provided by one of the following:\n- Written notice\n- Authenticated electronic notice (according to 15 U.S.C. § 7001, E-Sign Act)\n\n### Content of Notice to Individuals\nThe notice must be clear and conspicuous and include:\n- A description of the breach in general terms\n- A description of the type of sensitive information compromised\n- A toll-free number and website for more information\n\n### Attorney General/Department Notification\n**Requirement:** Yes, **within a non-extendable term of 10 days** after the breach is detected.\n\n**Notification Recipient:** Department of Consumer Affairs (DACO).\n\n**Critical Public Announcement Requirement:** DACO will make a **public announcement within 24 hours** after receiving the notification.\n\n### Substitute Notice Available\nAvailable if:\n- The cost of notifying all affected parties is excessively onerous or exceeds **$100,000**, OR\n- The number of affected persons exceeds **100,000**, OR\n- The entity does not have sufficient contact information\n\nSubstitute notice shall consist of:\n- Prominent display of an announcement at the entity's premises\n- Prominent display on entity website\n- Prominent display in informative materials\n- Communication to media informing them of the situation and providing contact information for follow-up\n\n### Third-Party Data Notification\nAny entity that resells or provides access to digital databases containing personal information files must notify the proprietor, custodian, or holder of the information of any violation of the system's security that has allowed access to unauthorized persons.\n\n## Exemptions, Penalties, and Other Provisions\n\n### Encryption Safe Harbor\nThe statute provides a safe harbor for information **protected by encrypted code**. However, password-only protection does **not** qualify for this safe harbor.\n\nThe notification requirement applies specifically to information \"not protected by encrypted code but only by a password.\"\n\n### Institutional Security Policy Exemption\nInstitutions may maintain preexisting institutional security policies that provide protection equal to or better than the statute's requirements.\n\n### Penalties\nThe Secretary of the Department of Consumer Affairs may impose fines of **$500 to $5,000** for each violation.\n\n**Important:** These fines do not affect the rights of consumers to initiate actions or claims for damages before a competent court.\n\n### Private Right of Action\nExplicitly granted by the statute. Consumers have the right to initiate actions for damages. The private right of action exists independently of and is not limited by any administrative penalties.\n\n## Key Provisions\n\n### Law Enforcement Delay Consideration\nThe timing of notification takes into consideration the legitimate needs of law enforcement agencies to secure possible crime scenes and evidence.\n\n### DACO Public Announcement Requirement\nThis statute includes a unique requirement that the Department of Consumer Affairs makes a public announcement within 24 hours of receiving breach notification, ensuring rapid public awareness.\n\n### Enforcement\nEnforcement is available through both administrative fines and private civil actions.\n"

Laws § 11-49.3-4 et seq.`\n- **Statute Title:** [Rhode Island Identity Theft Protection Act](http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE11/11-49.3/INDEX.HTM)\n- **Jurisdiction Type:** U.S. State\n- **Legislative History:**\n  - **Original Legislation:** H.B. 5684 (signed into law June 27, 2023, effective June 27, 2023)\n  - **Last Verified:** September 2025\n\n## Application & Covered Entities\nA municipal agency, state agency, individual, business or legal entity that stores, owns, collects, processes, maintains, acquires, uses, or licenses data that includes personal information.\n\n## Key Definitions\n\n### Personal Information\nAn individual's first name or first initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements, when either the name or the data elements are not encrypted or are in hard copy paper format:\n- Social Security number\n- Driver's license number, state identification card number, or tribal identification number\n- Account number, credit card number, or debit card number in combination with any required security code, access code, password, or personal identification number that would permit access to an individual's financial account\n- Medical or health insurance information\n- Email address with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual's personal, medical, insurance, or financial account\n\n### Encryption Definition\n\"Encrypted\" means the transformation of data through the use of a 128-bit or higher algorithmic process into a form in which there is a low probability of assigning meaning without use of a confidential process or key. Data shall not be considered encrypted if it is acquired in combination with any key, security code, or password that would permit access to the encrypted data.\n\n### Exclusions\nPersonal information does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records.\n\n### Breach of Security\nUnauthorized access or acquisition of unencrypted computerized data that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of personal information maintained by the entity.\n\n### Good-Faith Exception\nGood-faith acquisition of personal information by an employee or agent of the entity for the purposes of the entity is not a breach of the security of the system, provided that the personal information is not used or subject to further unauthorized disclosure.\n\n**Note:** The notification obligation applies to a breach of security of the system OR any disclosure of personal information.\n\n## Notification Requirements & Triggers\n\n### Notification Obligation\nAny Entity shall provide notification of (i) any disclosure of personal information OR (ii) any breach of the security of the system, that poses a significant risk of identity theft to any resident of Rhode Island whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person or entity.\n\n**Additional requirement:** Where affected employees are represented by a labor union through a collective bargaining agreement, a state or municipal agency employer shall also notify the collective bargaining agent of the breach.\n\n### Timing of Notification\nThe notification shall be made in the most expedient time possible but no later than **45 calendar days** after confirmation of the breach and the ability to ascertain the information required to fulfill the notice requirements and shall be consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement.\n\n**For state and municipal entities:** Notice must be given no later than **30 calendar days**.\n\n### Notification Methods\nNotice may be provided by one of the following methods:\n- Written notice\n- Electronic notice, if the notice provided is consistent with 15 U.S.C. § 7001 (E-Sign Act)\n\n### Content of Notice to Individuals\nTo the extent known, the notification to individuals must include:\n- A general and brief description of the incident, including how the security breach occurred and the number of affected individuals\n- The type of information that was subject to the breach\n- The date of breach, estimated date of breach, or the date range within which the breach occurred\n- The date that the breach was discovered\n- A clear and concise description of any remediation services offered

consumer's ability to file or obtain a police report, how the consumer can request a security freeze and the necessary information to be provided when requesting the security freeze, and any fees that may be required\n\n### Attorney General Notification\nIf more than **500** Rhode Island residents are to be notified, the Entity shall notify the Attorney General as to the timing, content, and distribution of the notices and the approximate number of affected individuals.\n\n**Additional requirement:** State and municipal agencies must also report cybersecurity incidents to the Rhode Island state police within **24 hours**.\n\n### Consumer Reporting Agency Notification\nIn the event that more than **500** Rhode Island residents are to be notified, the Entity shall notify the major credit reporting agencies as to the timing, content, and distribution of the notices and the approximate number of affected individuals.\n\n### Substitute Notice Available\nIf the Entity demonstrates that:\n- The cost of providing notice would exceed **$25,000**, OR\n- The affected class of subject persons to be notified exceeds **50,000**, OR\n- The Entity does not have sufficient contact information\n\nSubstitute notice shall consist of all of the following:\n- Email notice when the Entity has email addresses for the subject persons\n- Conspicuous posting of the notice on the Entity's website if the Entity maintains one\n- Notification to major statewide media\n\n### Third-Party Data Notification\nAny business that maintains computerized data including personal information that the business does not own or license shall notify the owner or licensee of the personal information of any security breach following discovery of the breach.\n\n### Credit Monitoring Services\nState and municipal Entities must provide remediation services for **five years** for adults 18 years and older, and not less than **two years** for those under 18.\n\n## Exemptions, Penalties, and Other Provisions\n\n### Encryption Safe Harbor\nThe law provides a safe harbor for encrypted data (128-bit or higher algorithmic process).\n\n### Own Notification Policy Exemption\nAny Entity that maintains its own security breach procedures as part of an information security policy for the treatment of personal information and otherwise complies with the timing requirements of the statute shall be deemed to be in compliance with the security breach notification requirements, provided such Entity notifies subject persons in accordance with such Entity's policies in the event of a breach of security.\n\n### Compliance with Primary Regulator Exemption\nAny Entity that maintains a security breach procedure pursuant to the rules, regulations, procedures, or guidelines established by the primary or functional regulator shall be deemed to be in compliance with the security breach notification requirements, provided such Entity notifies subject persons in accordance with the policies or the rules, regulations, procedures, or guidelines established by the primary or functional regulator in the event of a breach of security.\n\n### Federal Interagency Guidance Exemption\nA financial institution, trust company, credit union, or its affiliates that is subject to and examined for and found in compliance with the Federal Interagency Guidelines on Response Programs for Unauthorized Access to Customer Information and Customer Notice shall be deemed in compliance.\n\n### HIPAA-Covered Entities Exemption\nA provider of health care, health care service plan, health insurer, or a covered entity governed by the medical privacy and security rules issued by the federal Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to HIPAA shall be deemed in compliance.\n\n### Penalties\nEach reckless violation is a civil violation for which a penalty of not more than **$100 per record** may be adjudged. Each knowing and willful violation is a civil violation for which a penalty of not more than **$200 per record** may be adjudged. The Attorney General may bring an action in the name of the state against any business or person in violation.\n\n### Private Right of Action\nThe statute does not provide for a private right of action.\n\n### Waiver Not Permitted\nWaiver of compliance is not permitted.\n\n## Key Provisions\n\n### Delay for Law Enforcement\nThe notification required may be delayed if a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency determines that the notification will impede a criminal investigation. The law enforcement agency must notify the Entity of the request to delay notification without unreasonable delay. If notice is delayed due to such determination, then as soon as the law enforcement agency determines and informs the Entity that notification no longer poses a risk of impeding an investigation, notice shall be provided as soon as practicable. The Entity shall cooperate with law enforcement in its investigation of any breach, which shall include the sharing of information relevant to the incident; provided, however, that such disclosure shall not require the disclosure of confidential business information or trade secrets.\n"

governmental or regulatory entity that uniquely will identify an individual\n\n### Exclusions\nPersonal information does not include information that is lawfully obtained from publicly available information, or from federal, state, or local government records lawfully made available to the general public.\n\n### Breach of Security\nUnauthorized access to and acquisition of computerized data that was not rendered unusable through encryption, redaction, or other methods that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of personal information maintained by the Entity, when illegal use of the information has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur or use of the information creates a material risk of harm to a resident.\n\n### Good-Faith Exception\nGood-faith acquisition of personal information by an employee or agent of the Entity for the purposes of its business is not a breach of the security of the system if the personal information is not used or subject to further unauthorized disclosure.\n\n## Notification Requirements & Triggers\n\n### Notification Obligation\nAny Entity to which the statute applies shall disclose a breach of the security of the system to a resident of South Carolina whose unencrypted and unredacted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person when the illegal use of the information has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur or use of the information creates a material risk of harm to the resident.\n\n### Timing of Notification\nThe disclosure must be made

system.\n\n### Notification Methods\nNotice may be provided by one of the following methods:\n- Written notice\n- Telephonic notice\n- Electronic notice, if the person's primary method of

Other Provisions\n\n### Encryption Safe Harbor\nThe law provides a safe harbor for data rendered unusable through encryption, redaction, or other methods.\n\n### Own Notification Policy Exemption\nAn Entity that maintains its own notification procedures as part of an information security policy for the treatment of personal information and is otherwise consistent with the timing requirements of the statute shall be deemed to be in compliance with the notification requirements if it notifies subject persons in accordance with its policies in the event of a breach of security of the system.\n\n### Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Exemption\nThis section does not apply to a bank or financial institution that is subject to and in compliance with the privacy and security provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\n\n### Federal Interagency Guidance Exemption\nA financial institution that is subject to and in compliance with the federal Interagency Guidance Response Programs for Unauthorized Access to Consumer Information and Customer Notice, issued March 7, 2005, by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, as amended, is considered to be in compliance with this section.\n\n### Penalties\nA person who knowingly and willfully violates this section is subject to an administrative fine of **$1,000** for each South Carolina resident whose information was accessible by reason of the breach, the amount to be decided by the Department of Consumer Affairs.\n\n### Private Right of Action\nA resident of South Carolina who is injured by a violation of this section, in addition to and cumulative of all other rights and remedies available at law, may:\n- Institute a civil action to recover damages in case of a willful and knowing violation\n- Institute a civil action to recover only actual damages resulting from a violation in case of a negligent violation\n- Seek an injunction to enforce compliance\n- Recover attorney's fees and court costs, if successful\n\n## Key Provisions\n\n### Delay for Law Enforcement\nThe notification required by the statute may be delayed if a law enforcement agency determines that the notification impedes a criminal investigation. The notification required by the statute must be made after the law enforcement agency determines that it no longer compromises the investigation.\n\n### Attorney General/Consumer Protection Enforcement\nThe Department of Consumer Affairs Consumer Protection Division enforces this statute.\n"
